--- NOTES
<h3> What Is Additive Model? </h3>
An additive model is a time series in which the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations does not vary with level of time series. Data is represented in terms of addition of seasonality, trend, cyclical and residual components to give the observed series.

The additive model works best when the time series has roughly the same variability through the length of the series. The additive model is useful when the seasonal variation is relatively constant over time.

<h3> What Is Multiplicative Model? </h3>
The multiplicative model is a time series in which seasonal fluctuations increase or decrease proportionally with increase and decrease in the level of the series. Data is represented in terms of multiplication of seasonality, trend, cyclical and residual component to give the observed series.

The multiplicative model works best when the variability of the time series increased with the level. These model is useful when the seasonal variation increases over time.

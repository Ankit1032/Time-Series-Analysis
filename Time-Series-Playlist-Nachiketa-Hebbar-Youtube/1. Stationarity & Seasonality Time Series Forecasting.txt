# Stationarity 
It means the statistical properties more or less, are same over time.
Those properties are:
1. Constant Mean
2. Constant Variance
3. No Seasonality

#Seasonality : Means repeating patterns(Fluctuations) over time.

Note : Your data should be stationary if you want to create a Time-Series Model out of it.

#You Can find out if your data is stationary or not by plotting it year, quaterly, month, week or day wise.

# Ways to check if data is stationary
1. Visual Inspection(Graph Plotting)
2. GLobal vs Local Check
	- Global : find mean of the whole dataset
	- local : find mean of multiple samples in dataset
	- Now, check if both global and local mean almost matches.
	- if matches, then data is stationary else not stationary
	
3. There are some statistical tests to find out if data is stationary or not like:
	a. ADG(Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test
	b. KPPS Test
	
# Once you find out that your data is not stationary, you will have to work to convert that data into stationary in order to make a time series model with it.

# Some techniques to convert data into stationary
1. Differencing : Subtracting the time series which the values at different time period.
For example FIRST ORDER DIFFERENCING:
This means we subtract the current value with the previous time period value.
Similarly you can go for Second/Third Order Differencing.

2. Log Operation : can be used when you graph is increasing exponentially.

3. Seasonal Differencing: So instead of subtracting the value from previous time period, we are subtracting from previous time cycle, when it was repeating
-> Y(t) - Y(t-N)

Regression : Used to predict continuous value of an item based on certain parameters.

Auto : Uses its own past values to predict future values.
Correlation : An indicator of relationship between two variables.

ACF(Auto-Correlation Function) : Relationship of a variable with its previous time time period values(Lags)
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient): [-1 , 1]
1: indicates a very strong Correlation
-1 : indicates a negative Correlation

ACF : It takes into account the direct and indirect effect of values in Previous time lags with the current time period

(PACF) Partial Auto-Correlation Function : It takes into account only direct effects of Values in previous time lags with the current time period.

# In case of AUTO-REGRESSION, we use PACF.


--My Way of explanation between the difference between ACF and PACF

so to get which time period lag gives the best correlation, we keep plotting 
	plot 1= corr(Yt , Yt-1)
	plot 2 = corr(Yt , Yt-2)
	plot 3= corr(Yt , Yt-3)
	...
	plot k= corr(Yt , Yt-k)
and then check the best correlation

# The problem with ACF is when we calculating the corr(Yt , Y(t-2) ),we also know that Y(t-1) is indirectly influencing the correlation calculation. So, here comes PACF which removes the indirect correlation effect Y(t-1) while calculating corr(Yt, Y(t-2) ).

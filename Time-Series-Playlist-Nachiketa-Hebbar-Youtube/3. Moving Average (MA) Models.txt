Moving Average Models : 
It is a model that predicts future value of a time series using the past errors.

AR1(Auto regression) : Yt = C(1)Y(t-1) + C(2) + E(t)

MA1(Moving Average) : Yt = μ + C(1)E(t-1)

E : Error
μ : Baseline(Mean)

We use Past Errors to keep up with the trend

#For MA, we use ACF
#For AR, we use PACF

Prediction of How much gram of Gold you retailer needs

Day Prediction  Actual  Error
1	  10			    8		    -2
2	  9			      10		   1
3	  10.5		    10.5	  0
4	  10			    12		  2
5	  11			    10		  -1

So, on Day 1, We Predict 10 , so 10 is our Baseline. But we come to know we had an error of -2.
Hence, on the next day we conider our baseline and adjust 50% of the error (so we take C = 0.5 , C is an assumption)
Formula = μ + C(1)E(t-1) --> 10 + (0.5*-2) --> 10 - 1 -> 9 , So on Day 2 , we predict 9
Similary by watching all errors, we keep predicting
Remember this is MA(order = 1) as we r using a day lag only. If we had use 2 day lag then it would be called MA(Order = 2)

ARMA: Auto Regressive Moving Average
ARIMA: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average

AR[Auto-Regression]: Uses past values to make a prediction
	eq. y(t) = β0 + β1Y(t-1) + ε1
	-> AR(1)
	y(t): Is the value for which we are predicting the value at time t
	Y(t-1): Is the past value of time t-1
	β0 : Constant
	ε1: Current Error

MA[Moving Average]: Uses past errors to make a prediction
	eq. y(t) = β0 + θ1ε(t-1) + ε1
	-> MA(1)
	ε(t-1) : Error at time t-1
	
ARMA Model : Combination of AR and MA Model
	eq. y(t) = β0 + β1Y(t-1) + θ1ε(t-1) + ε1
	-> ARMA(1,1)
	
#HOW TO FIND THE ORDER OF ARMA(p,q)
1. We use ACF and PACF plots to find the order
2. ACF[Auto-Correlation function] 
	a. Measures direct and indirect effect of previous time lags on current value.
	b. Used to find order of Moving Average Model.
	
3. PACF[Partial Auto-Correlation function]
	a. Measures only the direct effect of previous time lags on current value
	b. Used to find order of Auto Regression Model
	
#WHAT IS ARIMA [Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average]
	a. ARIMA is almost ARMA, but the difference is that we first convert the Non-Stationary series into Stationary Series and then perform ARIMA.
	
	b. "Integrated": refers to a differencing operation that we need to do to convert non-stationary series into stationary. So, we perform a difference operation on the current value minus the previous time value.
	For example: we can do y(t) - y(t-1)
	
	c. Non-stationary means the average value of the graph is constantly increasing/decreasing and never almost constant.
	
	d. ARIMA(p,d,q) 
		p: Order of AR Model
		d: Order of differencing to get stationary series
		q: Order of MA Model
	
	Stationarity means :
		a. The graph should have an almost constant mean and variance. The Time Series can fluctuate by the fluctuation should be constant.
		b. There should not be any trends or repeating patterns.

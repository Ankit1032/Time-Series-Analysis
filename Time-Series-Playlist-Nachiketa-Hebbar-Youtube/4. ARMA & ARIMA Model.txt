ARMA : Auto Regressive Moving Average
ARIMA : Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average

AR[Auto-Regression] : Uses past values to make a prediction
	eq. y(t) = β0 + β1Y(t-1) + ε1
	-> AR(1)
	y(t) : Is the value for which we are predicting the value at time t
	Y(t-1) : Is the past value of time t-1
	β0 : Constant
	ε1 : Current Error

MA[Moving Average] : Uses past errors to make a prediction
	eq. y(t) = β0 + θ1ε(t-1) + ε1
	-> MA(1)
	ε(t-1) : Error at time t-1
	
ARMA Model : Combination of AR and MA Model
	eq. y(t) = β0 + β1Y(t-1) + θ1ε(t-1) + ε1
	-> ARMA(1,1)
	
#HOW TO FIND THE ORDER OF ARMA(p,q)
1. We use ACF and PACF plots to find the order
2. ACF[Auto-Correlation function] 
	a. Measures direct and indirect effect of previous time lags on current value.
	b. Used to find order of Moving Average Model.
	
3. PACF[Partial Auto-Correlation function]
	a. Measures only direct effect of previous time lags on current valye
	b. Used to find orde of Auto Regression Model
	
#WHAT IS ARIMA [Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average]
	a. ARIMA is almost ARMA, but the difference is that we first convert the Non-Stationary series into Stationary Series and then perform ARIMA.
	
	b. "Integrated" : referes to a differencing operation which we need to do to convert non stationary series into stationary. Sp, we perform difference operation on current value minus previous time value.
	For example: we can do y(t) - y(t-1)
	
	c. Non-stationary means the average value of the graph is constantly increasing/decreasing and never almost constant.
	
	d. ARIMA(p,d,q) 
		p: Order of AR Model
		d: Order of differecing to get stationary series
		q: Order of MA Model
